        <a href="http://conclave-app.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">Conclave</a> is a real-time collaborative text editor built in JavaScript.
      </p>
      <p>
        Intrigued by collaboration tools like Google Docs, we set out to build one from scratch. Conclave uses a <strong>Conflict-Free Replicated Data Type (CRDT)</strong> to make sure all users stay in-sync and <strong>WebRTC</strong> to allow users to communicate directly to one another without a central server.
      </p>
      <p>
        The result is a private and secure way for users to collaborate on documents. Read our <a href="https://conclave-team.github.io/conclave-site/" target="_blank">case study</a> to learn how we built it from scratch.

    <h2>Lists</h2>

    <p>
      Lists is a Python web application that helps me keep track of the <a href="https://nitinsavant.herokuapp.com/lists/movies" target="_blank">movies</a> and <a href="https://nitinsavant.herokuapp.com/lists/books" target="_blank">books</a> that I've seen and read.
