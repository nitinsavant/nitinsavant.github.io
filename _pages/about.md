Born and raised in Los Angeles to Indian immigrants, I spent my childhood playing with basketballs and computers. I survived engineering programs from one [small school](https://www.hmc.edu){:target="_blank"} -- while playing [Division 3 basketball](http://www.cmsathletics.org/sports/mbkb/index){:target="_blank"} -- and one [large school](http://asu.edu){:target="_blank"}. I spent the first 5 years of my career at an [enterprise software company](http://laserfiche.com){:target="_blank"}, making mistakes and learning a lot. Like a good millennial, I took some time off to travel and figure out what to do next. I settled in Minneapolis and have enjoyed being able to get anywhere in the city in under 20 minutes.

I'm always open to interesting projects and opportunities, so feel free to <a href="mailto:nitinsavant@gmail.com">contact me</a>!
