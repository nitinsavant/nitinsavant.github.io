[Conclave](http://conclave-app.herokuapp.com){:target="_blank"} is an open-source, real-time, collaborative text editor for the browser built from scratch in JavaScript.

Intrigued by collaboration tools like Google Docs, we set out to build one from scratch. Conclave uses **Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDT)** to make sure all users stay in-sync and **WebRTC** to allow users to send messages directly to one another. The result is a private and decentralized way to collaborate on documents.
